<h1>Welcome to CSV Tool</h1>
<h3>This project is now hosted on: http://96.126.127.207/</h3>
<h3>Created by William Warner</h3><br>

This Flask program allows users to upload CSV files and write queries to be performed on the data in plain english. The program translates the uploaded CSV file to an SQL table, then calls OpenAI API to translate that query into a valid SQL Query, perform that SQL query on the data, and visualize the results in an interactive web interface. Furthermore, if the query performed updated the sql table, you may download a new, updated csv file reflecting those changes.
<br><br>
This program can be extremely useful for quickly understanding some facts about a csv file you are working with. It allows for easy data manipulation and insights, even for those with no technical background. Simply upload your csv file, describe what you want done with the data, and viola! it is done!<br>
